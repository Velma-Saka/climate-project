Hello from Velma's first Git project!
# Climate Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes climate data for Kenya, including temperature, rainfall, and deforestation trends. 

## Objectives

## Git Workflow
- Created a feature branch `update-climate-notebook` to isolate updates
- Added `climate_data.csv` and updated `climate_analysis.ipynb`
- Committed changes in the branch, then merged into `master`
- Deleted the feature branch after merge

## Files
- `climate_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook 
- `climate_data.csv` — sample climate dataset
